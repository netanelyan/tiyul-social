// Republish to Instagram ONLY, for posts that reached Telegram and never made
// it to Instagram.
//
// This exists because of a real gap rather than as a convenience. When
// publishNext() recorded a card as published on the strength of Telegram alone,
// the card left the queue and the only thing kept about it was the row in the
// published log: id, pillar, tags, layout and the two destination flags. Not the
// headline, not the source URL, not the caption. So the store can say HOW MANY
// posts never reached Instagram and when, and cannot say which stories they
// were. The URLs have to come from you — they are in the Telegram channel, on
// the `מקור:` line of every post.
//
// Instagram only, deliberately. Re-approving through the bot would republish to
// Telegram too, and posting the same card to the channel twice to fix a gap on
// the other network is a worse outcome than the gap.
//
// Takes either a source URL or an id straight from the gap report. Prefer the
// id: it is the same identity the pipeline used, so it addresses feed sources
// whose items all share one landing page, which a URL cannot.
