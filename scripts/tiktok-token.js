 *
 * Nothing is trimmed off the end. A v2 code arrives percent-encoded and looks
 * like `...JbN8pg%2Av%215236.s1` — decoded, `...JbN8pg*v!5236.s1`. The `*` and
 * everything after it are PART OF THE CODE. An earlier version of this stripped
 * from the `*` on the strength of TikTok's v1 behaviour, where a literal `*1`
 * was appended and discarded; against v2 that silently sent a code truncated
 * two-thirds of the way through, and TikTok answers a malformed code with
 * "Authorization code is expired". Every fresh code failed, and the error
 * blamed the clock.
