//
// One PNG per emoji, committed to assets/emoji/. That is deliberate and it is
// the same argument the bundled Heebo makes: a slide that depends on whatever
// emoji font the machine happens to have is a slide that renders differently on
// the VPS than it did in review — and the failure is silent, because a missing
// emoji is a box rather than an error. Thirty small files remove the question.
//
// WHY NOT APPLE'S. Apple Color Emoji is what the team sees when they type, and
// it is the set these slides are trying to look like. It cannot be used here:
// the artwork is Apple's, it ships only with their operating systems, and Apple
// grants no licence to redistribute it. Rendering happens on an Ubuntu box, so
// there is no lawful path to it. Noto is the closest set that is actually
// licensed for this (OFL/Apache), and swapping to another is a matter of
// pointing SET_URL somewhere else — the renderer only ever asks for a file.
//
// JoyPixels is the nearest thing to Apple's drawings that can be licensed for
// commercial use, and it is a paid licence. If that is wanted, buy it and point
// this script at their assets.
