// The brief was explicit that this is general travel for Israeli travellers and
// that kosher/Shabbat is "one occasional thread among many, not the theme —
// I don't want to narrow the audience". A line in the drafting prompt saying
// "don't overdo it" is not a mechanism; a model that has just been handed three
// kosher-adjacent sources will cheerfully produce three kosher posts. So it is
// enforced as an arithmetic cap over a rolling window of what actually
// published, checked before a candidate can be staged.

// The pillars are the mix, so they are written as the five things this channel
// is for plus the two practical categories the source registry already feeds.
//
// The set they replaced — place / fact / hidden — was the spectacle problem in
// its purest form. "A genuinely surprising, verifiable fact about a place" is a
// brief that a colliding iceberg answers better than a market in Lisbon ever
// will, so the feed filled up with natural phenomena: a water spout, lava at
// Kilauea, a shipwreck, penguins. Every one of those cleared the old bar.
//
// None of them survives the new one, because none of them is somewhere a reader
// could go this year. That is the point: the buckets now name trips rather than
// subjects, and pillarDeficits() actively pushes the daily pick toward whichever
// of them has been quiet.
