// The real gate is the drafting step — it has read the page and it answers both

// dozen times a day, so if the ranking still puts eruptions and calving glaciers
// at the front, the whole budget is spent producing rejections and the good item
// eight places down never gets drafted at all. That is what happened: half the
// enabled registry is a natural-phenomena wire, and it won on recency every day.
//
// So the same question is asked cheaply here, in the only vocabulary a headline
// offers. Both are nudges rather than filters: a closure at a volcano is a
// perfectly good "conditions" post, and it will match both lists and net out
// roughly neutral, which is the correct treatment for an item that could go
// either way.
//
// The vocabulary list is not enough on its own, and the way it failed is worth
// writing down. Of the Smithsonian's twenty-two weekly reports, the two that
// ranked highest were "Asosan - Continuing Unrest" and "Iwatesan - Continuing
// Unrest", at 0.71 and 0.70 — seventh and eighth of sixty-five items, above
// every FCDO advisory. Neither says erupt, lava, ash plume or volcano: they say
// "unrest ... the Alert Level was lowered to 2". So the penalty was not merely
// missing them, it was SELECTING them — twenty of the twenty-two took the hit
// and the two that slipped through were promoted past everything by comparison,
// then survived the trip rule (a volcano is a real place a reader could stand
// near) while the institutional items above them were rejected. The daily pick
// was the two volcano items that had evaded the volcano filter.
//
// The alert-level dialect is added below, but a wire that is one phenomenon is a
// property of the SOURCE, not of any given item's wording — so `spectacle: true`
// in sources.json applies the penalty to every item from that feed regardless of
// how the week's report happens to be phrased. A penalty, still not a filter:
