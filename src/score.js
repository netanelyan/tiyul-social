// The real gate is the drafting step — it has read the page and it answers both
// questions properly. But the drafting step costs money and runs at most a
// dozen times a day, so if the ranking still puts eruptions and calving glaciers
// at the front, the whole budget is spent producing rejections and the good item
// eight places down never gets drafted at all. That is what happened: half the
// enabled registry is a natural-phenomena wire, and it won on recency every day.
//
// So the same question is asked cheaply here, in the only vocabulary a headline
// offers. Both are nudges rather than filters: a closure at a volcano is a
// perfectly good "conditions" post, and it will match both lists and net out
// roughly neutral, which is the correct treatment for an item that could go
