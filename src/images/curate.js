WHAT IS BEING LOOKED FOR

A photograph that makes somebody stop scrolling. In practice that means:

  - DEPTH. Something near, something far, a valley or a street receding. A flat
    wall photographed straight on is the opposite of this.
  - LIGHT. Golden hour, low sun, mist, dramatic sky. Flat midday light on a grey
    day is what a snapshot looks like.
  - A VANTAGE. Shot from above, from across a valley, from a hill. Eye level in
    a busy square is a tourist's photo.
  - ROOM AT THE TOP OR BOTTOM for text to sit in - sky, water, grass.

REJECT, and prefer a worse-composed photograph over any of these:

  - anything across the frame: wires, cables, scaffolding, a crane, a tarp
  - text, a watermark, a signboard, a logo
  - crowds of tourists, or a person posing for the camera
  - a flat building facade with no depth
  - obvious over-editing: neon-saturated skies, a fake-looking sunset

  - ANY large dark or blurred shape intruding at an edge or corner: a finger
    over the lens, a hat brim, a coat shoulder, an out-of-focus leaf or branch
    in the extreme foreground. Do not rationalise these as framing. Natural
    framing is sharp, recognisable and symmetrical - an arch, a window, a row
    of trees. A soft brown mass over the top of the sky is a thumb, and it is
    the single most common way a photograph that scores well on light and depth
    is nonetheless unusable.

A person walking away from camera, small in a landscape, is GOOD - it gives
scale and it is what the best travel posts do. A person facing the camera is a
portrait, and this is not a portrait.

IT MUST BE THIS PLACE

The slide names a place, and the photograph has to show THAT place - not another
building in the same city, not a nice view of the same country. A slide reading
"Strahov Monastery" over a photograph of a different baroque garden is the one
mistake that costs a travel page its credibility, and a viewer who has been
there spots it instantly.

If you are not confident the picture shows the named place, say 0. Being unsure
is itself the answer: a deck that drops a place is fine, a deck that mislabels
one is not.

AND IT MUST ACTUALLY SHOW IT

Being the right place is not enough. The named thing has to be the SUBJECT -
large in the frame, unmistakable, the thing your eye lands on first. Score that
in the subject field, out of ten, and be hard about it.

  9  the peak fills the frame, lit, nothing competing with it
  6  clearly the subject, but sharing the frame with a village or a valley
  3  it is in there somewhere, behind trees, small, low in the corner
  0  a bird, a cloud, a lake that happens to be near it

A picture of a mountain range with a bird in the sky and a snowfield along the
bottom edge is a photograph of a bird. A valley with a farmhouse, trees, a road
and a grey summit somewhere at the back is a photograph of a valley. Both of
those shipped on slides that named a mountain, and they are the reason this
field exists. When the best candidate is a 4, say 0 and let the caller look
again - there is always another query, and a slide that does not show its own
subject is not worth the place it takes.

Between two that both show the place, take the one that shows it BIGGER, even
if the smaller one has nicer light.

If nothing here both shows the place and is worth looking at, say 0. The caller
tries another search and then drops the place, which is the correct outcome.`;
