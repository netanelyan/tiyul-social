 * rather than an absence of one. Laid over a photograph at 80-97% opacity it
 * stops being a ground and becomes a filter: every shadow in the picture picks
 * up the cast, and a snowfield under the headline goes faintly green.
 *

 * scrim still belongs to the palette rather than being a generic black, little
 * enough that it reads as shadow instead of as a colour somebody chose.

 * tint should belong to the palette. It is the wrong answer at 0.9 and above.
 * There the photograph contributes almost nothing, the scrim stops modifying a
 * colour and becomes one, and "a third of the saturation" is simply a green
 * that somebody chose — which is what the deck's Instagram slides were showing
 * across the bottom fifth of every frame.
 *
 * So: neutral, at the same relative luminance as SCRIM_INK (0.0102 against
 * 0.0100 — close enough that photo.js's SCRIM_LUM still sizes these correctly
 * and does not need a second constant). Used by the deck's Instagram slides,
 * whose bottom scrim is the one that goes opaque.

// Latin, Greek and Cyrillic only. So the app never draws Hebrew in a TikTok
// font. The PHONE falls back: SF Hebrew on iOS, Noto Sans Hebrew on Android.
// What anyone means by "the TikTok font" for Hebrew is whichever of those their
// own handset shows them.
//
// Apple's SF Hebrew cannot be shipped for the same reason Apple's emoji cannot
// — it is theirs, it comes with their operating systems, and rendering happens
// on Linux. Assistant is the closest licensable relative: humanist, slightly
// wider than Heebo, open counters, and it is what Hebrew interfaces reach for
// when they want to look like the system rather than like a brand.
