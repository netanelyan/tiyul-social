// The same deck, drawn as a carousel of cards.
//
// A deck has always rendered twice — 1080x1920 for TikTok, 1080x1350 for
// Instagram — but both sizes came out of the same template, so the Instagram
// set was a TikTok slide with less headroom. That is the wrong artefact for the
// grid. A TikTok slide is designed to be legible over a video player's
// furniture, at arm's length, for two seconds, with no branding on it at all;
// an Instagram post sits in a feed next to our own news cards and should look
// like it came from the same account.
//
// So this module renders the deck's CONTENT in the CARD's design language:
// theme.js's baseCss, the same wordmark, the same accent rule under the same
// header, the same type scale. The words and the photographs are identical to
// the TikTok slides — this is one deck published twice, never two decks.
//
// WHAT IS DELIBERATELY DIFFERENT FROM THE TIKTOK SLIDE
//
//   - The text does not move. A TikTok slide runs a placement search to find a
//     quiet region of the photograph, because its text can go anywhere. A card
//     pins its header to the top and its headline to the bottom, so the search
//     is not merely unnecessary here, it would break the thing that makes a run
//     of cards read as a set: they line up. This also means the Instagram set
//     costs no image analysis at all.
//   - The brand is on it. Cards carry the wordmark and the site; TikTok slides
//     carry neither, on purpose (see the note at the end of renderSlideHtml —
//     a URL burned into a photograph reads as an advert).
//   - The slide is numbered. A carousel gives no progress indication of its
//     own, and a six-place list that does not say which place you are on is a
//     list you cannot navigate.

// Every slide is the card size. Imported from theme rather than from the deck's
// SIZES table so that a change to the card dimensions moves both together —
// these are cards, and the day they stop matching the cards is the day this
// stops doing its job.

/**
 * The scrims.
 *
 * Two gradients rather than one flat overlay, for the reason the card layouts

 * everywhere to fix contrast in two places. The top one carries the header, the
 * bottom one carries the name, and the middle of the picture is left alone.
 *
 * Strength comes from the measured scrim that render/deck.js supplies, and
 * otherwise from the card's own fallback — which is sized for the worst
 * photograph there is, and is the right way to be wrong.
 *
 * SCRIM_FLAT rather than SCRIM_INK, and the bottom scrim is why: it reaches
 * 0.97 at the foot of the frame, where the photograph is contributing three
 * percent and the scrim is the colour of the slide rather than a tint over one.
 * A palette cast is a tint; at this opacity it is a green rectangle. See the
 * note on both constants in theme.js.
 *
 * The middle stop is a share of the measured strength rather than a constant.
 * It was 0.86 against a fallback of 0.97, and left as a constant it would put
 * an 0.86 band ABOVE a measured 0.4 foot — the gradient would run backwards and
 * the measurement would buy nothing.
