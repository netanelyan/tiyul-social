// Where the words go, and what colour they are — decided by looking at the
// pixels rather than by asking a model.
//
// The previous version asked the vision call which third of the picture was
// "emptiest" and got back a word: top, middle, bottom. Three answers for a
// photograph, and the text was then centred inside whichever third it named.
// That is how a title ended up across the middle of a garden, and how white
// type ended up on a white sky.
//
// A model is the right tool for "is this the Eiger" and the wrong tool for
// "what is the mean luminance of the region the text will occupy". The second
// question has an exact answer, it is free, and it is the one that decides
// whether the slide is legible. So the photograph is drawn to a small canvas in
// the renderer's own Chromium and measured.
//
// What comes back is not a band but a position: the centre of the text block as
// a fraction of the frame, the colour to set it in, and how much help it needs
// from a scrim. The renderer applies that literally.

// The sampling grid. 45x80 keeps the 9:16 of the frame, which matters because
// every measurement below is taken in frame coordinates rather than image ones
// — the photograph is cover-cropped on the way in, exactly as CSS will crop it,
// so a region that measures empty here is empty in the render.
//
// Deliberately coarse. At this size a cell is ~24 real pixels, which is the
// scale legibility actually operates at: a lawn full of fine texture averages
// to a calm green, and that is correct, because type sits on it perfectly well.
// Sampling finer makes grass look as busy as a skyline.
