// Slideshow slides, set the way the two accounts this channel is modelled on
// set them.
//
// They are not one look, they are two, and trying to average them is what
// produced slides that belonged to neither:
//
//   MINIMAL (lucyysarchive). A photograph, the place's name, the country, the
//   flag under it. Small type — genuinely small, around 2.5% of the frame
//   height — in a normal weight, no outline, placed in whatever part of the
//   picture is empty. The photograph is the post and the words are a caption on
//   it. This is the one to reach for when the picture already answers "what is
//   it" and the only open question is "where is that".
//
//   INFO (adventurers00). Cream type with a bronze outline, the place's name
//   and then the same four measured facts on every slide, in the same order.
//   Louder, and it has to be: these slides are read rather than looked at.
//
// What both do, and what the earlier version of this file did not, is keep the
// type SMALL and the leading TIGHT. Every complaint about the old slides —
// awkward placement, too much space between lines, text eaten by the
// background — traces back to type set a third too large, a 1.34 line-height,
// and an extra flex gap on top of it.

// Both ends of a TikTok frame belong to the app, not to us: the search bar and
// slide counter at the top, the caption and handle at the bottom. The button
// rail down the right side is handled in render/photo.js instead, because it is
// a rectangle rather than a band and only TikTok has one.
// Instagram's numbers are not about furniture — the feed draws almost none over
// the image — they are about composition. At 80 and 110 the placement search
// could put a block within six percent of an edge, and it did whenever the
// quietest part of a photograph happened to be the very top of the sky: type
// pinned to the rim of the frame reads as a mistake rather than as a choice.
// These give it a margin to breathe in without meaningfully narrowing the
// search.

   cover — which meant "make the type smaller" was an edit to nine literals in
   this file and a judgement call about each one. They are now one percentage
   and a set of ratios off it, so the scale moves together and the decision is
   editable by somebody who is not reading this file.

   At the default the name sets at 32px on a 1080-wide frame, against 51px
   before. That is a large change and it is the intended one: the old size was
   read off reference slides at a moment when the type was also outlined and
   centred, and all three together are what made these read as a graphic laid
   over stock rather than as somebody captioning their own photograph.

   The leading opens up as the type shrinks, which is the opposite of what the
   old comment here reasoned — and both are right. 0.98 was holding a 51px name
   together across a wrap; at 32px the same ratio collides the two lines of a
   name, because the absolute gap is what the eye reads and it has been cut by a
