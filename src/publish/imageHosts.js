// Where rendered cards are served from, and which of those domains TikTok will
// actually fetch from.
//
// Two different questions that look like one:
//
//   1. WHERE DO WE PUT THE IMAGE. Instagram and TikTok both fetch the bytes
//      themselves, so a card has to sit on a public https URL. That used to be
//      one value, CARD_PUBLIC_BASE_URL. It is now a list, because one host is a
//      single point of failure for the only step in the pipeline that cannot be
//      retried locally.
//
//   2. WILL TIKTOK FETCH IT. This is NOT the same question, and treating it as
//      the same is the trap this module exists to close. TikTok only downloads
//      images from a domain verified under URL properties in the developer
//      portal. Point a card at an unverified host and TikTok does not tell you
//      that is what went wrong — the post fails with url_ownership_unverified
//      at best, and at worst simply never fetches. Adding a second image host
//      is therefore the exact moment this becomes silent, so the check is a
//      preflight that runs before init and names the domain it refused.
//
// The second list is declared, not inferred. Deriving "verified" from "wherever
// we happen to serve from" would make the check agree with any mistake it was
// written to catch.
