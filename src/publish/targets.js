// publish is a queue that quietly eats everything you approve.

 * Not a config value, an editorial rule: a news card is written for a feed and
 * a deck is written for a scroll, and posting either one in the other's place
 * is what makes a channel look automated.
 *
 * One destination each, and nothing to Telegram. A card is a feed post and
 * belongs on Instagram; a deck is a vertical scroll and belongs on TikTok. The
 * earlier arrangement sent both kinds to two or three places at once, which
 * made every account a copy of the others — and a follower who sees the same
 * post three times is being given two reasons to unfollow.
 *
 * Telegram keeps its real job. It is where cards are APPROVED, and that path
 * does not go through here at all: approval runs on STAGING_CHAT_ID, publishing
 * on CHANNEL_ID, and only the second one is a destination. Nothing about the
 * DMs you approve in changes because the channel stopped receiving posts.
