// Instagram publishing, through the official Graph API only.
//
// Two auth paths exist and they are not interchangeable:
//
//   IG_AUTH=instagram  (default) — "Instagram API with Instagram Login".
//       Host graph.instagram.com. No Facebook Page required at all. Tokens are
//       long-lived (60 days) and MUST be refreshed before they lapse.
//   IG_AUTH=facebook             — "Instagram API with Facebook Login".
//       Host graph.facebook.com. Requires a linked Facebook Page. The Page
//       token it yields never expires, so there is nothing to refresh.
//
// The default is `instagram` because it needs no Page and two permissions
// instead of four. The cost is that its token expires, which is why
// refreshToken() exists and why bot.js calls it on boot and daily. A 60-day
// token with no refresh is a pipeline that works perfectly until it silently
// stops two months in — the exact failure the Page-token path avoided.
//
// The publishing handshake itself is identical on both:
//   1. POST /{ig-user-id}/media         with image_url  -> a creation_id
//   2. POST /{ig-user-id}/media_publish with creation_id -> the published post
//
// In step 1 the bytes do NOT travel through our request — we hand Instagram a
// URL and Instagram's servers fetch it themselves. That is why rendered cards
// must live somewhere publicly reachable over https (CARD_PUBLIC_BASE_URL), and
// why a card that only exists on local disk cannot be published.
