// The last piece of connecting TikTok from a browser instead of a terminal.
//
// The flow, end to end, and where this file sits in it:
//
//   1. www.tiyulplus.com/tiktok/connect  sends the owner to TikTok with a state.
//   2. TikTok redirects back to          www.tiyulplus.com/tiktok/callback?code=…
//   3. That page validates its own state and POSTs the code here.
//   4. This exchanges the code for a token pair, stores it, and answers with
//      the account it just connected.
//
// Steps 1–3 are the website's, and they already exist. Only step 4 needs to run
// inside the bot, for one reason: the token pair has to land in the same
// data/store.json the bot publishes from, and the refresh token that comes with
// it cannot be replaced without a browser. Anything that writes it from another
// process is writing to a file a long-running process holds in memory.
//
// WHY THIS LISTENS ON LOCALHOST ONLY
// Caddy on the VPS terminates TLS and proxies cards.tiyulplus.com/tiktok/* to
// 127.0.0.1:8787. Binding 0.0.0.0 would publish an endpoint that takes a shared
// secret straight to the open internet on a plain HTTP port, bypassing the
// thing holding the certificate. The bind address is not a preference.

// Wrong guesses are answered slowly, and after a handful the endpoint stops
// answering them at all for a minute. The counter is global rather than
// per-IP on purpose: behind a proxy the only address seen is Caddy's, and a
// forwarded header is a claim by the caller, not a fact. One account connects
// here, once in a while, so a global lockout costs nothing real and cannot be

 * matters more than it looks: store.js keeps the whole document in memory and

 * file (the save is a tmp-plus-rename) but would silently roll back every
 * change made since it loaded. Running in the bot's own process, through the
 * bot's own store module, there is one copy of that document and one event loop
 * touching it; setTikTokToken() is synchronous from read to rename, so no
 * concurrent publish can interleave with it.
