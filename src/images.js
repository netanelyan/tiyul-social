// Image provenance.
//
// The brief allows exactly three origins for a photograph, and forbids one
// specific thing absolutely:
//
//   allowed:  commercial-license stock | our own catalogue | AI-generated
//   never:    an image lifted from a news article or a business's own page
//
// So this module is not a fetcher with a policy bolted on — it is the policy,
// and fetching is what the individual providers do underneath it. Every image
// that reaches the renderer carries a provenance tag, that tag is printed in
// the approval message *and* on the card itself, and anything without one is
// refused rather than published with a shrug.
//
// Pexels is wired as the stock provider. The other two remain stubs: our own
// catalogue needs photos to exist first, and AI generation is deliberately last
// because of the constraint below, which rules it out for exactly the case
// people reach for it (a picture of the place the post is about).
