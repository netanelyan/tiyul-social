// Numbers off Wikidata, for the slides where a number IS the slide.
//
// The pipeline's rule everywhere else is that a claim must be quotable, word
// for word, from a page published by the body that speaks for the place. That
// rule is right and it stays — but it cannot be met by a mountain. A summit has
// no official website, no operator and no opening hours; there is no page to
// quote, which is why summit decks came back as bare names when the one fact
// anybody wants is how high it is.
//
// Wikidata is the answer to that and it is a better one than prose would be.
// P2044 is a number with a unit attached, edited in public, with its own
// source: there is no sentence for a model to misread and no paraphrase for it
// to slip a digit into, because nothing is being written at all. The value is
// copied. The QID is recorded next to it, so every field on a slide can still
// be traced to where it came from.
//
// What this is NOT is a licence to put anything on a slide that Wikidata knows.
// The test for a field is the same as it ever was: would it change which one I
// pick. Height decides which summit; the year a mountain was first climbed is
// a lovely fact and decides nothing, so it is not here.
