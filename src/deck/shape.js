//
// Not a rule per category, because the right answer is not a property of the
// category. A mountain carries its name and nothing else — the photograph has
// already said everything, and a bullet about opening hours under a peak is
// absurd. A cathedral in a city is different: the picture shows a beautiful
// building and the viewer still does not know what it IS, so two short lines
// earn their place.
//
// Hardcoding that as trail=none, museum=bullets gets the common cases right and
// then fails on the interesting ones: a famous viewpoint in a city wants
// nothing, a hike with a genuinely strange story wants a line. So the deck
// decides for itself, once, and then every slide in it looks the same — the
// consistency within a deck is what makes it scan.

// Classification against a fixed schema — is this visitable, does it carry bullets.

const SYSTEM = `You decide whether one travel slideshow needs text under its place names.

THE DEFAULT IS NO.

A slide is a photograph and the name of what is in it. Every word added past
that competes with the picture, and the posts that work hardest at this add
nothing at all.

SAY NO when the photograph carries the whole idea:

  mountains, lakes, fjords, waterfalls, beaches, viewpoints, canyons, islands
  - anything where the answer to "what is it" is visible in the frame, and the
  only question left is "where is that". A name and a country is the entire
  slide.

SAY YES only when knowing the name leaves an obvious question unanswered:

  a building in a city, a museum, a market, a neighbourhood, a restaurant - a
  viewer sees a handsome facade and has no idea what is inside, what happened
  there, or why it is on a list. One or two short lines answer that.

If it is genuinely borderline, say no. A deck can always be re-run; a slide
overloaded with text is the thing being corrected here.`;

const KEEP_SYSTEM = `You are given entries from a travel guide's page about one destination.

Two questions, and an entry has to pass BOTH to be kept.

FIRST: is it a place at all?

Some entries are PLACES. Others are sections of the guide - advice about
flights, where to stay, when to visit, how to get around, or the destination
itself as a heading.

A place, for this purpose, is somewhere a traveller physically stands: a
temple, a lake, a quarter, a market, a peak, a museum, a beach. It can be
photographed, and a photograph of it would show something specific.

Drop, always:

  - the destination itself ("Kyoto", "Kyoto - the city")
  - anything about getting there: flights, airports, transfers, car hire
  - anything about planning: when to go, how long to stay, what it costs,
    where to sleep, what to pack
  - a region so broad that a photograph of it would show anything at all

This matters because each survivor becomes one slide with its name written
across a photograph. "Flights from Tel Aviv" as a slide in a slideshow about
Kyoto is the single most embarrassing thing this channel could publish, and it
happened, which is why you are being asked.

SECOND: is it the thing THIS deck is about?

The deck has a subject and it is stated below. Every slide has to be an example
of it. This is not a preference about balance - a deck titled "the most
beautiful mountains in Italy" that ends on a photograph of a market has told
the viewer something false, and that has happened too.

The guide files places into broad buckets, so the bucket cannot answer this and
you are seeing the names instead. Judge what the place IS:

  mountain   a thing that RISES: a peak, a summit, a massif, a ridge, and a
             named summit is still one when there is a terrace or a cable car
             on top of it. NOT a lake below it, not the valley it stands in,
             not the town you drive through to reach it, and obviously not a
             market or a museum in that town.
  trail      a walking route you follow from one end to the other. NOT the lake
             at the end of it and NOT the town the trailhead is in.
  waterfall  falling water. Nothing else.
  beach      a beach.
  museum     a museum or a gallery.
  food       a market, a food hall, a restaurant, a cafe.
  attraction the WIDEST of these, deliberately - it is the catch-all a city
             deck uses, and judging it narrowly empties good decks. Anything a
             traveller goes to in order to look at it: a castle, a palace, a
             temple, a church, a monument, a tower, a quarter, a square, a
             garden, a famous grove, a viewpoint, a bridge, a zoo. It does NOT
             have to be a building and it does NOT have to be old. Drop only
             what is plainly something else - a restaurant, a shop, a hotel, a
             station - or a whole separate town.

A NOTE ON HOW HARD TO PUSH. The failure being corrected is a market on a
mountain deck: a slide that makes the cover a lie. It is not "this is a
slightly odd choice". Drop what is the WRONG KIND OF THING, and keep what is
merely a weaker example of the right one.

When the name alone cannot settle it, the description is there. When it still
cannot be settled, keep it when the deck's subject is the catch-all one and
drop it otherwise - the narrow kinds are where a wrong slide shows.

Keep the good ones in the order given. Keeping very few, or none, is a correct
answer and often the right one: this page may simply not be about that subject.
Do not pad the list to make it look useful.`;

 * The entries whose names the model asked to keep.

 * so it still matches itself.
