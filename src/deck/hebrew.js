// Every name on a slide, in Hebrew.
//
// The channel is Hebrew and the slides were shipping "Piz Bernina" and
// "Aletschhorn" in Latin, which is the most visible possible sign that nobody
// looked at the post before it went out. It happened for a dull reason:
// Wikidata has a Hebrew label for the famous places and not for the rest, and
// the code fell back to the English label whenever the Hebrew one was missing.
//
// A fallback to English is the wrong shape of fallback. The right one is to
// transliterate, which is what an Israeli writing about the place would do, and
// which a model is genuinely good at — it is a spelling task in a language with
// settled conventions, not a judgement call.
//
// The guard afterwards matters as much as the call. A name that comes back
// still containing Latin letters is not used, and the place is dropped: a deck
// one slide shorter is a small cost, and it is paid once, whereas an English
// name on a Hebrew slide is the thing being fixed.

// Every viewer reads the place name; a wrong transliteration is the most visible error on a slide.

You are given place names in Latin script. Return each one as an Israeli would

THE ESTABLISHED NAME WINS

Where Hebrew already has a settled name for a place, use it - even when it is
not what the letters would give you.

  Mont Blanc      -> מון בלאן
  Matterhorn      -> מאטרהורן
  Jungfrau        -> יונגפראו
  Dolomites       -> הדולומיטים
  Lake Bled       -> אגם בלד
  Cinque Terre    -> צ׳ינקווה טרה

TRANSLITERATE THE REST, BY SOUND

Follow how the name is pronounced in ITS OWN language, not how it looks in
English. That is the difference between a name an Israeli recognises and one
that looks like it was typed by a machine.

  Piz Bernina     -> פיץ ברנינה
  Aletschhorn     -> אלטשהורן
  Seceda          -> סצ׳דה
  Grossglockner   -> גרוסגלוקנר
  Chamonix        -> שמוני            (French: the x is silent)
  Zermatt         -> צרמט

DO NOT TRANSLATE THE MEANING

A name is a name. "Lago di Braies" is אגם בראייס, never "האגם של בראייס"; a
"Horn" stays הורן and does not become קרן. The only words that translate are the
generic ones Hebrew always translates: Lake -> אגם, Mount -> הר, Valley -> עמק.

FORM

Hebrew letters only. No Latin characters anywhere in the answer, not even for a
number or a roman numeral. No nikud. No explanation.

If you do not know how Israelis write a particular place and cannot work it out
from its own language's pronunciation, return an empty string for it. An empty
answer costs one slide; a guess that reads wrong costs the channel's voice.`;

/**
 * Hebrew names for a list of places, in one call.
 *
 * Keyed by qid so the caller can look each one up without relying on the model
 * returning them in order — it usually does, and "usually" is not good enough
 * when the consequence is a mountain labelled with a different mountain's name.
 *
 * Places that already have a Hebrew label on Wikidata are not sent: that label
 * is better than anything this can produce, and every one omitted is tokens not
 * spent.
