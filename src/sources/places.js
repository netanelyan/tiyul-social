// Which places a themed deck should be about — and nothing else.
//
// This module answers "what are the five best-known hiking routes in the
// Dolomites", "which museums in Prague", "where does Osaka eat". It does NOT
// answer what goes on the slides. That distinction is the whole design:
//
//   OpenStreetMap and Wikidata are crowd-sourced. They are excellent at
//   enumerating what exists and roughly how well known it is, and they are not
//   the publisher of any fact about it. So a place's OSM tags select it and
//   rank it, and then every SENTENCE that reaches a slide has to come from the
//   place's own official page, quoted verbatim, exactly as every other post in
//   this pipeline works.
//
//   The one documented exception is a structured measurement — an elevation, a
//   length, a founding year — read straight off a Wikidata property by
//   deck/facts.js. There is no page to quote for the height of a mountain, and
//   a summit deck with no heights on it was the result. A property is not
//   prose: nothing is written, the value is copied with its unit, and the QID
//   travels with it. Prose about a place still needs its official page.
//
// What travels out of here is therefore a shortlist: a name, a location, a
// Wikidata id, and — the part that matters downstream — the official website
// Wikidata records for it (P856), which is the domain a claim about that place
// is allowed to be quoted from.
//
// The precedent for a dataset source living alongside the feeds is climate.js:
// Open-Meteo is queried, not subscribed to, and it earns its place by answering
// a question no feed can. Same here.

// Mirrors, not one endpoint.
//
// The main instance is free, popular and rate-limited, and "429 Too Many
// Requests" arrives often enough that retrying the same host is not a strategy
// — it is the host telling you to go somewhere else. These run the same data
// and the same query language, so falling through costs nothing but a second.

/**
 * What kinds of deck we know how to gather candidates for.
 *
 * Each is a fragment of Overpass QL rather than a free-text query, because the
 * tags are what make the shortlist defensible: `route=hiking` is a thing OSM
 * has a definition for, "nice walks" is not.
 *
 * `sourced` is the newer and more consequential flag, and it splits this table
 * in two.
 *
 * A SOURCED kind carries quoted facts: a museum has an official page with its
 * opening hours on it, and every sentence that reaches a slide comes off that
 * page. That is the standard the rest of this file exists to uphold.
 *
 * An UNSOURCED kind carries a name, a country and a photograph, and nothing
 * else. Not a lowering of the standard — a different artefact. A mountain has
 * no official website, which is why the idea prompt used to warn the model off
 * proposing mountains at all, and why a channel built on this table drifted
 * toward museums and markets. Landscape is most of what a travel slideshow IS,
 * and the honest way to publish it is to stop pretending there is a page to
 * quote rather than to keep refusing the subject.
 *
 * So the unsourced kinds route to deck/build.js's free-form path, which was
 * already written for exactly this shape and was reachable only by typing
 * `/deck free` by hand.
 *
 * The last five have no `q` at all. Nothing in OSM agrees on what a village
 * worth photographing is, and the aurora is not a place — those decks name
 * their own places, which is what the free-form path does.
 *
 * `needsWikidata` is where the standard bites. A place with no Wikidata entry
 * has no official-website record either, so nothing about it could be quoted
 * from an authority — it would be a slide with a name and no facts. Kinds
 * where that is common are still declared, so the shortfall is visible rather
 * than looking like an empty region.
