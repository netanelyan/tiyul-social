// This replaces the OpenStreetMap route for any city tiyulplus.com covers, and
// it is better in every way that matters to a slideshow:
//
//   - the names are already Hebrew, so nothing has to be transliterated
//   - the descriptions are written for travellers, which is exactly the
//     material a hook needs. "a chapel decorated with tens of thousands of
//     bones" is on the page; OSM could only ever say ossuary=yes.
//   - a rating, a price band and a visit duration come with each place
//   - the list is curated, so ranking is not a proxy problem
//
// What it gives up is independence: the authority for a fact about Charles
// Bridge is now our own site rather than the bridge's. That is a deliberate
// choice — these entries are verified before they are published there — and it
// is why the slide still quotes the page verbatim and the approval message
// still prints the URL. The mechanism is unchanged; only the publisher is.
//
// Parsed from the rendered HTML rather than an API, because there is no API.
// The JSON-LD block carries only a dozen attractions and none of the rating,
// price or category fields, so the cards themselves are the better source.
