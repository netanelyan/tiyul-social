// The owner's override, and the record of what it stepped over.
//
// Every guard in this project exists to protect the FEED from the pipeline: a
// quota so one pillar cannot become the whole channel, a dedupe window so the
// same story is not drafted twice, a daily target so the approval queue does
// not turn into a rubber stamp. None of them exists to protect the feed from
// its owner, who can already publish anything by hand.
//
// So when the owner asks for a post, the guards give way. What they do NOT do
// is give way quietly. The whole value of a quota you are allowed to break is
// that breaking it is a decision — "two Dolomites decks back to back" should be
// something chosen, not something noticed a week later in /mix. Every bypass is
// recorded here with the measurement that would have blocked it, and the caller
// is expected to say so in Telegram before the post goes out.
//
// AsyncLocalStorage rather than a parameter threaded through fifteen
// signatures, because the guards are scattered across candidate.js, pipeline.js
// and bot.js, and a flag passed by hand is a flag that gets dropped in the one
// path nobody tested. The store is scoped to the triggering command, so a timer
// firing mid-run cannot inherit it.
//
// What is deliberately NOT bypassable here:
//   - TikTok's 5-posts-per-24h cap and every other platform rule. Those are not
//     ours to waive; see TIKTOK_DAILY_CAP in publish/tiktok.js.
//   - hasPublished(), which stops the same post reaching real followers twice.
//     That is not a quota, it is a duplicate, and the owner asking for a second
//     Dolomites deck is asking for a different post rather than the same one.
